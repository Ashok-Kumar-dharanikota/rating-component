## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Select and submit a number rating.
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating.

### What I learned

During the development of the Rating Component, I learned how to create a dynamic and interactive website. This project reinforced my understanding of event listeners and the DOM manipulation in JavaScript. One of the crucial takeaways was the ability to update elements dynamically based on user interaction, providing a seamless experience.

### Continued development

I'm interested in reimplementing this rating component using React.js in the future. This will allow me to understand the differences in logic and implementation when moving from vanilla JavaScript to a more structured framework like React.
